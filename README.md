### FOSS Finder

FOSS Finder is a free and open-source software alternative recommendation website. The website allows users to find free and open-source alternatives to proprietary software across different categories such as office suites, multimedia tools, developer tools, and more. FOSS Finder is currently being built and maintained by a team of students.

### Proposed Features

* Browse different categories of software alternatives
* Filter results based on platform, license, and popularity
* View detailed information about each software alternative, including its features, user reviews, and download links
* Submit new software alternatives to be added to the website
* Review existing alternatives to help others find the best options

### Getting Started

To get started with FOSS Finder, clone the repository and enter the foss-finder/FossFinder directory using a terminal. Then run the command "python manage.py runserver" to see a local version of the server. Intended features will allow you to browse different categories of software alternatives, search for specific software titles, and filter results based on your preferences.
